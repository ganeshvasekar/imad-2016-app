	    Brain computer interfacing is a communication pathway between humans brain to
computer. Basic need of Brain computer interfacing for the disabled person means
handicapped person such as hearing problem, visibility problem etc. It also used in daily
life generally mouse, keyboard as input of the computer but by using brain computer
interfacing connecting mind as input of the computer is possible. It is used for the writing
on the document by using mind, speaking by mind (who cannot speak), and selecting
function on computer such as copy file, pest file, and delete file. In this project Study of
brain computer interfacing is done by using Fourier transform analysis of EEG signal.
MATLAB is used for the analysis of the EEG signal.
